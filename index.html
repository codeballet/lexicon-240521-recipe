        <h1>Make your own sourdough culture</h1>
        <p>
            Making your own sourdough for bread baking
            is healthy and tasty.
            However, many people seem to have the
            impression that it is very difficult to
            create and maintain a sourdough culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I explain below, making your own sourdough is
            surprisingly easy. Just follow the below
            recipe and method.

        <h2>How to do it</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Find a nice jar that you like.</li>
            <li>Put a couple of hanful measures of rye flour in the jar</li>
            <li>Pour some water into the jar and stir</li>
            <li>Adjust the balance of water and flour until the solution gets a thick, creamy consistency, possible
                to pour from the jar</li>
            <li>Cover the jar, but do not seal it airtight, as the air in the jar need to be able to escape</li>
            <li>Let the solution rest for 24 hours in a dark place in room temperature</li>
            <li>For seven days, pour out half of the solution, then add a bit of new flour and water</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Helpful notes to consider</h2>
        <p>
            Do not fill the jar up to more than half. The sourdough will start to rise
            and needs some room to expand.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you can, use organic flour and filtered water.
            This will facilitate the growing of the wild yeast.
            However, just ordinary wholegrain rye
            flower and drinking water will also work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Check the progress and status of the
            sourdough by smell. After three to four days,
            it may start to smell a bit unpleasant. However,
            after around seven days and upwards, the yeast
            should have killed off most of the odour producing
            bacteria, and it should have a deep,
            interesting, almost beer-like smell.
