        <p>Many people seem to feel that it is very
            difficult to create and maintain a sourdough
            culture.

            However, making your own sourdough is

            <h2>Helpful notes to consider</h2>
            <p>
                Do not fill the jar up to more than half. The sourdough will start to rise
                and needs some room to expand.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you can, use organic flour and filtered water.
                This will facilitate the growing of the wild yeast.
                However, just ordinary wholegrain rye
                flower and drinking water will also work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Check the progress and status of the 
                sourdough by smell. After three to four days, 
                it may start to smell a bit unpleasant. However, 
                after around seven days and upwards, the yeast 
                should have killed off most of the odour producing 
                bacteria, and it should have a deep, 
                interesting, almost beer-like smell.
